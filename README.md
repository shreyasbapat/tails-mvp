# How to spin-up the application


Install Anaconda/Miniconda : https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

After this: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shreyasbapat/tails-mvp.git
$ cd tails-mvp/
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate tails
$ python app.py
```

And then your app will be up and running.

If you find any issues, don't open an issue in the github issue tracker, rather report it on tails@shreyasb.com
